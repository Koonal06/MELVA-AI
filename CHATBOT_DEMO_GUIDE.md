7. Click **Continue** and open **Ask Melva**.

## 2. How To Chat (Best Pattern)

`hi`
2. Choose focus when asked:
`rhythm`
3. State a real problem:
`I can’t stay in time when strumming. Give me a 25-minute plan.`
4. If Melva asks diagnostic question, answer directly:
`accuracy`
5. Ask for progression:
`make it slightly harder`
6. Ask for immediate action:
`give me a drill I can do right now`
7. Ask for summary:
`summarize today’s plan in 4 steps`

## 3. High-Impact Demo Prompts
- `I am frustrated with chord changes in jazz.`
- `Build a 25-minute practice plan for romance rhythm guitar.`
- `Analyze my issue: I speed up in chorus.`
- `I keep struggling with rhythm. What should I focus on this week?`
- `Switch from harmony to rhythm now.`

## 4. What To Highlight During Demo
- Adapts to onboarding genre and level.
- Detects emotion words like `frustrated` and adjusts tone.
- Creates dynamic **Today’s 25-Minute Plan**.
- Detects recurring weakness and suggests weekly focus.
- Handles topic switching with clarification.
- Switches between teaching mode and micro-coaching mode.

## 5. Control Prompts (if responses are too long)
- `micro coaching mode`
- `short answer only`
- `one step at a time`

## 6. Recovery Prompt (if flow goes off)
`Reset and give me one simple beginner exercise for rhythm.`

## 7. 3-Minute Presenter Script (Optional)
`This is MELVA, our adaptive AI music tutor.`
`It starts from user profile context: genre, level, and focus area.`
`Now I ask a real problem prompt, and MELVA responds with structured guidance.`
`It can detect frustration and switch to supportive coaching.`
`It can generate a dynamic 25-minute practice plan, not a static reply.`
`If a weakness repeats, MELVA detects it and suggests a focused weekly improvement track.`
`It also manages topic switching and asks clarification when the user jumps too fast.`
`So this behaves like a tutor workflow, not just a scripted chatbot.`
